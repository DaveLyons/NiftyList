=============
General To-Do
=============
Nifty List--bundle Nifty File?
NL: Finder dumping stuff needs to check for NIL icKind string (did I already do that?)
NList.Data/Technote--document SCSI.MGR errors ($FFxx)

NLClassifyAddr: return "=" for tool.setup patches (as opposed to TSx)
R: show the entire resource search path

Make w command show "name+xxxx" (finish the nlAddressInfo service and use it)

Accept finderSaysBeforeOpen to install additional NL modules (and remove old one)

check WAPs for validity (v cmd) ???
cmd to purge data file
Allow redirection to files
  (redirect to a RAM-based text device that sends to a pathname?)
Allow redirection to scrap manager
Dynamic symbol tables for the user?
user-defined templates for dumping data structures
Use ByteWorks debugging info when found
User stack of address values to pop back to:
  << pulls from stack
  >> pushes to stack
Redirect output to files (redir to RAM-based text device that sends to a pathname)
Hex/dec/etc converter

Note that there is no nesting of [ ] operators (gives wacky results) (or fix it)

session callback--getkey should return modifiers
session callback--poll for abort
session callback--Pascal strings?


=================
to do in a module
=================
show GS/OS device list
Multi-bank Search command, including branch references!
Show info from GetLoadSegInfo
Resource stuff:
  List all loaded resources
  List all resources in open res files


=======
Goodies
=======
¥\aerr command to show network errors (section in data file)
¥\acmd command to show AppleTalk command numbers (section in data file)

\ctls -- dump contro list, one line per control
\leh -- dump a Line Edit record handle (make ;c use this automatically?)
Goodies--dump a tagged-strings structure by handle


==================
Big Brother module
==================
Code analyzer: Note "cmp #0, beq/bne"
Watchdog $00/BE00 to see if the GS/OS stack is getting whomped on

Need a "start tracing" option when BB complains--communicate with GSBug
need a "don't break on this call any more" option
check ShieldCursor flag on QD calls
flag insufficient stack space likely on toolbox calls
Get info from app about dp/stack size and location

Catch a TaskMaster call iwth the SystemEvent record pointer?


====================
Expression evaluator
====================
NL: Have ` store the result into the current-address

Toolbox calls--show result parameters by name

Errors:  report message and then ask for permission to terminate
    expression evaluation.

"Identifiers" allowed (alphanumeric plus underscore)--look up in data
    files or symbol tables (unquoted).

Miniassembler-ish:  instruction -> byte string  (single quotes?)

"\" introduces blank-terminated name of a function, either built-in or
  in an external-module.


=================
NL to-do
=================
Resource stuff:
  Locate owner of a resource [how to find filename??]
  List all loaded resources
  List all resources in open res files
  Include resource info in "i" list? [is speed a problem?]
  Show name/info of open res file(s)
  Show current ResourceUserID

;q -- dump a queue
dump interrupt-time status; modify interrupt-time status??
device listing
s: class-1 prefixes?
