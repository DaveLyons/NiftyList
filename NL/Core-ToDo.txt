*** w: show xxxxxxx+nnnn
***   nlAddressInfo

*** don't allow expressions to take 0 source characters?

; Dump info on all desk accessories
;\files should show os-busy error
;~m--hard-code additional message types?
;Are all the scrap types hard-coded now?

;\find should be able to search language-card memory
; ;s should know about language card memory (it half knows?)
; stack dump--reject apparent JSRs/JSLs from invalid addresses, like $6exxxx.

;Nifty List--make "0r" show entire search path, with a marker for the current file.

; resource name support?

; Use GetLoadSegInfo to show info on first segment
; NiftyList--turn off Hires switch
; NList: add a \tcount command to count toolbox calls by function, by tool set, with or without click.
; 	flags\tcount #NewHandle (flags=1 to click, 0 to not click)
; 	\tcount = display count
; 	\tcount 0 = stop counting
; 	\tcount ffff = count everything
; 	\tcount 2 = count Memory Manager
; NList command to dump Font Manager data structures.
; NL: annoying 0i rsrc display
; NList: Need error messages for stuff like OS busy, Loader not available, Resource Manager not available?
; NList--command to dump in hex with a specified number of bytes per line
; Data file sections:  Generic Constants? (SysBeep2 codes, AlertWindow codes)
; Use ClassifyAddr on Vector jumps?
; Need shorthand for "dot infinity" (as in dump from here on)
; Nifty List--names for scrap types (in generic constants?)
; Nicely display allocated user IDs (clone $E10FD0 and sort by $1322, display in groups)
; NL -- switch to class-1 GetPrefix for S display
; "1000 \find..." doesn't work (keeps bank byte)
; Make ClassifyAddr check for Tool.Setup patches.
; \fill
;Dump text screen to file?
; 
; NList command to go through a hunk of code and find places where
;   JMP/BRL can be BRA, etc.
; 	JMP, BRA, BRL to next location
; 	LDA <dp, PHA --> PEI
; Search for repeated sequences of bytes (how??)
; Search for sequences like PEA 0, PEA 0 that can be optimized
;
; Search for references to a particular location (absolute, minus one 2-byte,
;   minus-one 3-byte, branches)
;
; On NewHandle, allocate small check handle afterwards, for trash checking.
;
; define new globals for nlGetAGlobal: address of NL Info table, service address, system patch id
; 
; Provide service call access through SendRequest
; SendRequest to DAL Systems~Nifty List~
;     reqCode = $8000+service
;     dataIn = long input value
;     dataOut points to (countWord,LongResult)
;
; aa/bbb.cc/ddd;h -- ignores cc
; Change more SHOW4's into Show4Procs?
; handle\pict command
; Check for error on GetMapHandle?? (Check for NIL?)
; ;N mask: show bit-by-bit breakdown of mask
; Dump Menus
; dump control-list summary (1 line per control:  Handle, Kind, ID?)
; "@" operator
;   ( ) Don't let \find find the "always" copies.
;   ( ) Make ">s" work only for the standard text session?
;
;Finish the Nifty NDA

*** Goodies:  handle\pict
*** service call to load another module?
*** ship an Installer script!
*** ship a "remove Nifty List" application?
*** should display symbolic names on branches and jumps, not just calls.
*** ;s should know location of ChooseCDA stack
*** ;s should know about language-card bank switching
*** nlSetSession--bits 31-24 are flags, 31=nonText session (don't allow Ctrl-T, etc)
*** sessions:  Ctrl-T and Apple-xxx are inappropriate during Pause
*** need to preserve session state variables at the right times
*** When should actEnter be called?  Now returning from monitor calls it. ???
*** should keep data file handle unlocked most of the time while NL is active
*** SANE stuff (fix parameters in tool calls, show specific calls if PEA)
*** AppleTalk stuff (show call names for calls to the main vector)
*** re-entrancy? count and show at prompt:  3 NL>
*** InstallHook
*** RemoveHook
*** GetLn
*** "*@*" marks unimplemented service handlers
