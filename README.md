This is the Nifty List version 3.5p Classic Desk Accessory (CDA) for the Apple IIgs,
from around 1993. The build tools were MPW IIgs. It's mostly interesting for
historical purposes.

Line endings have been converted to LF for macOS. If you actually try to
use this, the existing code expects CR line endings in the "data" files,
such as NList.data (which has an unexpected ".txt" extension here for
convenience).
